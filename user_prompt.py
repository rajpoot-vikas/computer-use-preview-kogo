USER_MAIN_PROMPT = """**Objective:**  
Automate the process of searching for parcel information using a parcel number on tax website with resilience to page variations, pop-ups, agreements, and modal dialogs.

**Steps:**

1. **Page Preparation**
   - Wait for the main search interface to fully load.  
   - Detect and handle any overlays, modals, or pop-up agreements (such as disclaimers, terms of service, or consent dialogs) by interacting with 'Agree', 'Accept', or similarly labeled buttons, ensuring the search input is accessible.

2. **Select Year (if required) and Enter Parcel Number**
   - Check if a 'Year', 'Tax Year', 'Tax Roll', or similar selector (dropdown, radio buttons, tabs) is present and required to enable the search.
   - If present, select the year : {search_year} first. Prefer the latest or default year when no explicit instruction is given.
   - After selecting the year, wait for the form to refresh or inputs to become enabled.
   - Locate the search field designated for parcel numbers.
   - Enter the provided parcel number: {parcel_number}.
   - If multiple search fields are present, ensure the correct one is selected (e.g., labeled as "Parcel Number", "Parcel ID", or similar).
   - Edge case: If selecting the year clears or resets the parcel field, re-enter {parcel_number}.

3. **Trigger Search Action**
   - Identify and click the appropriate search or submit button, which may be labeled "Search," "Go," or contain a similar action term.
   - If the button is disabled, verify that both the year (when required) and parcel number are set, then retry.
   - Wait for the search results section to load fully (use explicit waits for content, results, or the "loading" indicator to disappear).
   - Handle edge case: If button click fails, try pressing 'Enter' key in search field as alternative

4. **Handle Unexpected Dialogs and Popups**
   - Monitor for any unexpected pop-ups, error messages, or information dialogs throughout the process.
   - If such elements appear (e.g., session warnings, information/disclaimer popups, or modal overlays), interact with them to dismiss, continue, or agree, as appropriate.

4a. **Disambiguate Multiple Results**
    - If the search yields multiple results, scan the results list for the entry matching the exact parcel number {parcel_number}.
    - Programmatically identify and click the corresponding "View Details," "Select," or equivalent action button/link for that specific parcel.
    - Ensure navigation proceeds only after confirming the correct parcel has been selected and the details page is loading.

5. **Access Parcel Details**
   - Once the results are visible, find and click the link or button to view the details for parcel number {parcel_number}.
   - If multiple results appear, match the exact parcel number before proceeding.

6. **Navigation & Finalization**
   - Confirm successful navigation by waiting for the parcel details page or section to load.
   - Verify that the detailed parcel information for {parcel_number} is visible and accessible, indicating the workflowâ€™s success.

**General Robustness Considerations:**
- Use flexible selectors and timeout/retry logic to account for variable load times and layout changes.
- Include error handling for missing fields, timeouts, or site maintenance notifications.
- Prefer the latest available year when a year must be selected and no explicit year is provided.
- Re-validate that both year (if required) and parcel inputs are set before attempting search.
- Log each step and any exceptional events (e.g., repeated modals, search failures, multiple matches).
"""

USER_MINIMAL_PROMPT = """
Objective:
Retrieve parcel details for {parcel_number} using the fewest possible interactions.

Principles:
- Do only what is strictly necessary to complete the search.
- Prefer defaults; change settings only if required to enable search.
- Minimize clicks/keystrokes and page traversals.
- Dismiss blocking elements only when they prevent interaction.

Steps:
1. Wait until the search interface is usable (inputs enabled, not covered by overlays).
2. If search requires a year selection to enable input or search, set it to {search_year}; otherwise leave the default.
3. If a search type selector is present (e.g., Parcel/Parcel ID, Property ID, Account/Account ID, Account Number, ID, Owner), choose the option that corresponds to parcel/account identification (typically labeled as "Parcel", "Parcel ID", "Account", "Account ID", "Account Number", "ID", or similar).
4. Enter {parcel_number} in the parcel/account input field. The field may be labeled as "Parcel Number",  "Property ID", "Parcel ID", "Account Number", "Account ID", "ID", or similar variations. If year selection clears it, re-enter once.
5. Trigger the search using the primary search button; if not clickable, press Enter in the input.
6. If multiple results appear, choose the exact match for {parcel_number} (which may be displayed as parcel number, account number, account ID, or ID) with a single click.
7. Open the parcel details if needed and stop once the details page/section is visible.

Minimal robustness:
- Use generic, resilient selectors; retry each critical action once.
- If a modal/overlay blocks interaction, click a single Agree/Accept/Close action to proceed.
- Use short explicit waits for visibility/enablement;
- Do not open new tabs or navigate elsewhere unless the site forces it.
- Log only brief outcomes of each step.
"""

USER_FLEXIBLE_PROMPT = """
**Objective:**
Flexibly navigate diverse tax websites to find and view parcel details for {parcel_number}. This may require a sequence of actions for a single logical step.

**Core Principles:**
- **Adaptability:** Assume websites vary. Adapt to different layouts, labels, and multi-step workflows.
- **Resilience:** Handle common web obstacles like pop-ups, varied navigation, and search result formats.
- **Efficiency:** Prioritize actions that lead directly to the parcel details.

**Workflow Steps:**

1.  **Navigate to Search Portal (If Necessary):**
   - **Goal:** Reach the property search form.
   - **Actions:** Wait for the page to load. If not on a search page, look for links like "Property Search," "Tax Records," "Parcel Search," or "Assessment Data." This may involve one or more clicks to navigate through introductory pages or menus to reach the search portal.

2.  **Prepare the Search Form:**
   - **Goal:** Make the search form accessible and ready for input.
   - **Actions:** Wait for the page to load. Dismiss any initial overlays, disclaimers, or cookie banners by clicking "Accept," "Agree," "OK," or a close icon ('X'). This might be a multi-step process if there are several modals.

3.  **Configure Search Criteria:**
   - **Goal:** Correctly set all required fields before searching.
   - **Actions:**
     - **Search Type:** If a choice is offered (e.g., "By Parcel," "By Owner"), select the option for "Parcel Number," "Account ID," or a similar identifier.
     - **Year Selection:** If a tax year selector is present, set it to `{search_year}`.
     - **Parcel Input:** Locate the input field (e.g., "Parcel Number," "Account Number," "Property ID"). Enter `{parcel_number}`.
     - **Self-Correction:** If any selection (like year or search type) clears other fields, re-enter the necessary information. Ensure all required fields are correctly populated before proceeding.

4.  **Execute Search:**
   - **Goal:** Trigger the search and wait for results.
   - **Actions:** Click the "Search" or "Submit" button. If that fails or is not available, press the 'Enter' key in the parcel number input field as an alternative. Wait for the results to load.

5.  **Process Search Results:**
   - **Goal:** Locate and select the correct parcel from the search results.
   - **Actions:**
     - **No Results:** If no results are found, the task is complete with a "not found" status.
     - **Multiple Results:** If a list is shown, scan for an exact match of `{parcel_number}`. This may require scrolling or clicking through pagination ("Next," page numbers).
     - **Select Match:** Once the correct entry is found, click the corresponding link or button (e.g., "View Details," "Select," or the parcel number itself) to proceed to the details page.

6.  **Confirm and Finalize:**
   - **Goal:** Verify that the correct parcel's detail page is displayed.
   - **Actions:** Wait for the parcel details page to load. Confirm that the page displays detailed information for `{parcel_number}`. Once the details are visible, the task is successfully completed.
